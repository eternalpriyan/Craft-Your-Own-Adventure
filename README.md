# Craft-Your-Own-Adventure

Uses Craft's hierarchical page structure as a natural branching narrative tree, with the AI reading and writing directly into the document as you play. 

Craft Your Own Adventure is a single HTML file. Choose to run it by downloading it to your system and opening page. Or run it online. 

- Chat interface - You interact with Gemini (or Claude via API) through an HTML window
- Live writing - The AI writes the narrative directly into your Craft doc as it generates
Branching structure 
- Craft Doc structure as branches - When you make a choice, it creates a subpage for that branch
- State awareness - The app reads the existing page hierarchy to know where you are in the story and continues from there
